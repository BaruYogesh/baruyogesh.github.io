            <h1>My Journey</h1>
            <p>
              In August 2018, I left my home just north of Columbus and started my CS degree at UC. A year later, I started my first Co-Op at Siemens PLM Software, a half-hour drive away from campus. I worked on an ML Research Team.
              After another semester of school in the Spring of 2020, I did another Co-Op at Siemens in Summer 2020, where I worked on a Full-Stack web team.

          <div class="job" id="job-2">
            <h1>Co-Op Program Participation</h1>
            <p>
              Through the Co-Op program, I've been able to explore my interests in a porfessional environment to get a better idea of what I want to do when I leave school.

          <div class="job" id="job-3">
            <h1>Learning and Growth through Co-Op</h1>
            <p>
              When I started Co-Op, I thought I already knew everything and a job would be easy. To my surprise, what I knew was only the beginning of what I needed to know. I learned a lot on the job through mentors and making mistakes and gaining experience.

          <div class="job" id="job-4">
            <h1>If I could start all over again</h1>
            <p>
              I'd start doing LeetCode earlier, and make more interesting and fun personal projects. As well, I would have accepted a different offer that I had at the time rather than work at Siemens.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="job" id="job-5">
            <h1>Goals for the future</h1>
            <p>
              With the experience and knowledge that I now have, I want to gain more experience at a large tech company in a tech hub in the future in my following Co-Ops.
