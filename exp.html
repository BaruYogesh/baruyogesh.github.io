            <h1>Siemens, Summer 2020</h1>
            <p>
              In the Summer of 2020, I worked on a different set of projects under the same team at Siemens. The first project I worked on involved optimizing a front-end data visualization in Node.js. Elements were being rendered in SVG and managed through D3.js. When several hundreds of elements were loaded, browser performance started to suffer. My solution was to re-implement the visualization in HTML canvas, which is a single HTML element that can be operated on. This resulted in approximately a 30% increase in browser performance.
              Another task that I worked on was about API design in Java. To serve this front-end application, we needed to deliver graph data through REST. The data could not be sent in its stored state so I worked with another co-op to write Java classes that converted the graph data format to JSON. 
              These projects were important to me because they helped me grow as a full-stack engineer.
              As this was my first remote work experience, I had to learn communication skills and work ethic. I believe these skills will be even more important as work from home has started to become more normalized and popular at different companies.

            <h1>Siemens, Fall 2019</h1>
            <p>
              In the Fall of 2019, I worked on a research-and-development team. My main job was to explore different open-source ML repositories and research papers to find a way to apply them to business needs.
              My research was focused around Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and 3D modeling. The plan for the research was to implement a new feature in NX, Siemens' popular CAD software.
              I was able to instantiate a Natural Language Processing prototype to turn user commands into machine instructions in Python. This project was important to me because it introduced me to the world of ML.
              Outside of my technical experience, I learned a lot about professionalism, teamwork, and responsibility due to this being my first co-op. These are skills that I'll need for my entire career.
